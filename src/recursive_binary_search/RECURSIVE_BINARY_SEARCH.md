# Recursive Binary Search

Modify [Binary Search](https://github.com/AlbertHambardzumyan/searching/tree/master/src/binary_search) to use recursive
 method *recursiveBinarySearch* to perform a binary search of the array. The method should receive the search key, 
 starting index and ending index as arguments. If the search key is found, return its index in the array. If the search
 key is not found, return â€“1.

 
### Big O of the Recursive Binary Search

The recursive binary search algorithm runs in O(log n) time.
