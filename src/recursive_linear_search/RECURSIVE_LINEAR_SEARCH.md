# Recursive Linear Search

Modify [Linear Search](https://github.com/AlbertHambardzumyan/searching/tree/master/src/linear_search) to use recursive
 method *recursiveLinearSearch* to perform a linear search of the array. The method should receive the search key and 
 starting index as arguments. If the search key is found, return its index in the array; otherwise, return â€“1. Each call
 to the recursive method should check one index in the array.
 
 
### Big O of the Recursive Linear Search

The recursive linear search algorithm runs in O(n) time.
