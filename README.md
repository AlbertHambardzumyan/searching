Searching Algorithms.


## Introduction

*Searching* data involves determining whether a value (search key) is present in the data and, if so, finding its 
 location. Looking up a phone number, finding a website via a search engine and checking the definition of a word in a 
 dictionary all involve searching large amounts of data. Two popular search algorithms are the simple linear search 
 (one that is easy to program yet relatively inefficient), and the faster but a bit more complex binary search (one 
 that is relatively efficient but more complex and difficult to program).
